# VR Finite Automata

This application allows users to create and simulate deterministic finite automata (DFA) in a virtual reality environment. There are also a small number of challenges that present a target language for which the user must create an automaton that accepts the language.

Customisable planets are used to represent states in automata, with Earth representing the initial state an planets with orbiting moons representing accepting states.

The application was developed for the Oculus Quest 2 virtual reality system, although it uses Unity's OpenXR implementation so it should also work with other systems but this has not been tested.

A number of project assets were used under various attribution licences detailed in the "Attributions.md" file.
